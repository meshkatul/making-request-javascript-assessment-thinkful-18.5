All of the functions that you will need to fill in are included in this file.

getAllNames()
Method	Path
GET	/constellations
The getAllNames() function should make a GET request to /constellations. With the data that is returned, modify it so that you return an array that contains the names of each constellation. Use console.log() to print the names of the constellations.

getAllNames(); //> [ "Columba", "Crater", ... ]
getConstellationsByQuadrant()
Method	Path
GET	/constellations
The getConstellationsByQuadrant() function should make a GET request to /constellations. It should return all responses where the quadrant matches what was given. For example, if "SQ1" is provided as the quadrant, only those constellations should be passed into the console.log() statement.

getConstellationsByQuadrant("SQ1");
/*
  [
    {
      id: "UEUrlfX",
      name: "Columba",
      meaning: "Dove",
      starsWithPlanets: 3,
      quadrant: "SQ1",
    },
    {
      id: "KGQIwSq",
      name: "Eridanus",
      meaning: "River",
      starsWithPlanets: 26,
      quadrant: "SQ1",
    },
    ...
  ];
*/
Note: Make a simple GET request to the /constellations route. Do not use any query parameters. Upon receiving the data, use JavaScript to manipulate what is logged.
